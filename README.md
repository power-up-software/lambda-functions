# lambda-functions

This repository provides an extension to the java lambda function. The library provided by java is rather limited, only
providing an option for one parameter and requiring a return value. There are also a few other variations such as
consumer and runnable. However, even those do not support multiple parameters.

This project supports both void and non-void returns for 2-5 parameters.
